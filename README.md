# LMpackage_examples
Octave Etard ( octave.etard11@imperial.ac.uk )

This repo contains examples illustrating the use of the [LMpackage](https://github.com/octaveEtard/LMpackage) on real EEG datasets.

**Requires Matlab R2019b or newer** (tested on R2019b & R2020a).


## Quick start

### Installation
Add the `functions` folder(s) to your path. All function are prefixed with `LM_` so as to reduce the risk of shadowing any of your own functions. These examples require the [LMpackage](https://github.com/octaveEtard/LMpackage) to be in your path, as well as some [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php) functions to load the data.
